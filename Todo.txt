config file:
    - configurable cost per book?
    - support other costs (leather, 3 pages, ink)

standalone editor for the books (with automatic uploading!)

reorganize commands for efficiency

figure out a way to asynchronously create book files
	(SHOULD be thread safe as long as we add it to the inventory with a synchronous task,
	but early asynchronous URL import attempts did fail with that implementation..)

message logger and configurable strings.yml

customize metrics so it disables based on MY config, not the main one

method for ops to check others' mail - useful if players can mail to a collective complaints box, etc.
The rebellion must be crushed at all costs.
