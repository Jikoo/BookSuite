config file
rip design off of PrintingPress (stairs upside-down above, slab on use, revert to stairs)
use book materials - ink, book (feather? perhaps configurable cost... copy.other for increased cost. Food for thought.)
Permissions todo:
    - copy.self - default to true
    - copy.other - op
    - copy.free - op, requires adding book material usage.
    - deny - prevent usage completely (make crafting bench open as usual and not display a message?)
